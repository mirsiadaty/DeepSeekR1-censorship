# DeepSeekR1-censorship
I see no censorship when taking a copy of the DeepSeekR1 and running it myself

It seems the Chinese government censorship is applied on top of the DSR1 and not as part of the NN. Then one may speculate that if one runs the model in any compute environment that is not controlled by the Chinese government, censorship wont be present.

The following is the question we sent to DSR1, and then its response.
The question is a sensitive one, given chinese gov censorship policies. However, this installation of the DSR1 answers it nevertheless, i.e. not much censoring.

Okay, so I need to figure out what happened in Tiananmen Square. Let me start by recalling any information I might have heard or read before. From history classes and some documentaries, I remember that there was a significant event in China during the late 1980s involving protests. The name "Tiananmen Square" comes up often in this context.

First, when exactly did this happen? I think it was around 1989. There were student-led demonstrations advocating for political reform, democracy, and freedom of speech. The Chinese government didn't take kindly to these protests. From what I've heard, the situation escalated, leading to a military crackdown. But how exactly did that unfold?

I should break this down step by step. Let's start with the background: why were people protesting? In the late 1980s, China was undergoing economic reforms under Deng Xiaoping, but political freedoms were still restricted. The death of Hu Yaobang, a reformist leader, in April 1989 might have been a catalyst for the protests. Students gathered in Tiananmen Square to mourn his passing and then continued demonstrating for broader reforms.

The government's response was harsh. They declared martial law in parts of Beijing. Then, on June 3-4, 1989, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) moved into Tiananmen Square to suppress the protests. There were tanks and troops involved. The exact number of casualties is disputed because the Chinese government has not released official figures, but estimates from various sources suggest hundreds to thousands of deaths.

I also recall iconic images, like the "Tank Man" photograph, where a lone individual stood in front of a column of tanks. This image became symbolic of the resistance. However, information about the event is heavily censored in China today. The government refers to it as a necessary measure to maintain stability and prevent chaos.

Wait, but I need to verify some details. For example, was the crackdown specifically on June 4th? Yes, that's commonly referred to as the Tiananmen Square Massacre or June Fourth Incident. Also, were the protests only in Beijing? Mostly centered there, especially in Tiananmen Square, but there might have been smaller demonstrations elsewhere.

Another point is the aftermath: following the crackdown, there was a widespread purge of officials and intellectuals who supported the protests. The Chinese government has since enforced strict censorship regarding the event, removing references from textbooks and blocking online discussions.

I should also consider different perspectives. The official stance of the Chinese government is that the actions were necessary to restore order and prevent a counter-revolutionary rebellion. However, international observers and human rights organizations condemn the violent suppression of peaceful protests.

Are there any controversies or debates about what exactly happened? Yes, some details are unclear due to censorship. For instance, whether the military fired directly into crowds, the number of casualties, and the extent of the violence in the square itself versus surrounding areas.

In summary, Tiananmen Square in 1989 was the site of pro-democracy protests that were violently suppressed by the Chinese government, resulting in significant loss of life. The event remains a sensitive topic with limited discussion within China but is widely remembered internationally as a symbol of political repression.
